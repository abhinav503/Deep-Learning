# Deep-Learning

The file cnn.py is doing image classification of a Dog and a Cat using the Flow from directory method of Keras Library.
Convolutional neural network has been used for the process with 2 Convolution and Max Pooling layer and one Hidden layer giving nearly 
81% of accuracy on Test Set. 
The algorithm is giving nearly 81% of accuracy because of Image Augmentation done on the training set.
